## Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

    void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
    int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
    int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
    boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

    You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
    Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

## Design HashSet

Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

    add(value): Insert a value into the HashSet. 
    contains(value) : Return whether the value exists in the HashSet or not.
    remove(value): Remove a value in the HashSet. If the value does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

Note:

    All values will be in the range of [0, 1000000].
    The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 10000].
    Please do not use the built-in HashSet library
