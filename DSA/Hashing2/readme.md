## Contiguous Array

Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

    Example 1:
    Input: [0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

## Longest Palindrome

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

 

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "abccccdd"
    Output: 7
    Explanation:
    One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
